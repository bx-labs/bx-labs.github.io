# How it works

This is an execution infrastructure, not a judgment engine.

---

## Inputs

- Source code (repo / workspace)
- Policy packs & configuration
- Declared RPC endpoint (customer-chosen)

## Execution

- Fixed **binary-only** engine
- Runs **locally** or in **CI**
- No hidden network calls

## Outputs (auditable artifacts)

- `audit-pack/`
- `manifest.json`
- Hashes & versions

## Verification

- Independent replay
- Hash comparison
- Third-party reproducibility
